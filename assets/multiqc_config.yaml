    description: "Total originally mapped reads are randomly subsampled at 50% and 90% density. The similarity QC indicator (simQCi) refers to the fraction of chromatin regions which reveal a proportional decrease of read count intensities (RCIs) in the subset sampled at 90% relative to that sampled at 50% and is plotted for 3 dRCI thresholds, namely, 2.5%, 5% and 10%. simQCi should decrease with increase in dRCI and lower simQCi is an indicator of good overall quality. In other words, the flatter the line the higher the quality. The minimal theoretical value for simQCi is 1."
