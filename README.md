## Developer notes

### Use pre-commit hooks

Pre-commit can automatically format your code, check for spelling errors, etc. every time you commit.

Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/#installation) if you haven't already,
then run `pre-commit install` to install the hooks specified in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
Pre-commit will run the hooks every time you commit.
